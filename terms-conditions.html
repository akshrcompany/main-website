        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 1 February 2025</p>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Akshr</strong>! These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for using our website, products, and services. By accessing or using any of our offerings, you agree to comply with these terms. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, well... you know the drill-kindly exit the page.</p>
    
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By engaging with Akshr-whether by purchasing a product, using our services, or even browsing our site-you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these terms. Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to legal stuff!</p>
    
        <h2>2. Orders, Payments & Cancellations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All orders placed on our platform must contain accurate and complete information. If your order is misplaced due to incorrect details, that's on you.</li>
            <li>We support multiple payment methods, but once a transaction is processed, it is final-no take-backs.</li>
            <li><strong>Order cancellations:</strong> We offer a <strong>6-hour window</strong> for cancellations with a full refund. After that, you can cancel, but <strong>no refund</strong> will be provided. Check our <a href="refund-policy.html">Refund Policy</a> for the full details.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>3. No Funny Business (User Conduct)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We encourage creativity but within ethical and legal boundaries. No hacking, fraud, or any illegal activities on our platform.</li>
            <li>Do not impersonate Akshr, its employees, or any other users. We appreciate admiration, but let's keep it real.</li>
            <li>Respect intellectual property rights. If it's ours, don't steal it. If it's yours, we respect it.</li>
            <li>Any attempt to misuse, exploit, or disrupt our services may result in legal action (yes, we take this seriously).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>4. Refunds & Replacements</h2>
        <p>Here's our golden rule: <strong>If it's a service, no refunds.</strong> If it's a product, read our <a href="refund-policy.html">Refund Policy</a>. Once an <strong>AkshrCard</strong> is shipped, there's no turning back-so be sure before you buy.</p>
        <p>Received a damaged or tampered package? <strong>Don't accept it!</strong> Report it to us immediately, and we'll work on a replacement with possible compensation.</p>
    
        <h2>5. Service Terms & Non-Refundable Payments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All service payments, whether partial or full, are <strong>non-refundable</strong>. This applies to IT services, software development, UI/UX design, and consultation.</li>
            <li>Once a payment is made, there are no chargebacks, rollbacks, or second thoughts. If you've paid, we assume you want the service.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>While we strive to provide the best possible experience, we cannot guarantee a perfect world. We are <strong>not liable</strong> for any indirect, accidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of our products and services. Basically, use our services wisely.</p>
    
        <h2>7. Privacy & Data Protection</h2>
        <p>Your data is your data. We don't sell it, trade it, or misuse it. Check our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> to learn how we handle your information.</p>
    
        <h2>8. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p>Everything you see on our website-from content to branding-belongs to Akshr. Reproducing, copying, or redistributing any part of our website or services without prior permission is strictly prohibited.</p>
    
        <h2>9. Updates & Modifications</h2>
        <p>These terms may change from time to time as we grow and evolve. It is your responsibility to stay updated. We may or may not notify you, so it's best to check back periodically.</p>
    
        <h2>10. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes arising out of these terms shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
