        <h1>Refund & Replacement Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 1 February 2025</p>
        <p>At <strong>Akshr</strong>, we believe in delivering excellence, whether it's a cutting-edge tech solution or a simple AkshrCard. 
            While we'd love for every transaction to be a happy one, we understand that sometimes things don't go as planned. 
            So, here's our official (and hopefully painless) refund and replacement policy.</p>
    
        <h2>1. AkshrCard Refund & Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Order Cancellation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changed your mind? No worries! You can cancel your order <strong>within 6 hours</strong> and receive a <strong>full refund</strong>.</li>
                    <li>After <strong>6 hours</strong>, you can still cancel, but unfortunately, we can't process a refund. (We'd love to, but the system doesn't let us!)</li>
                    <li>Refunds, if applicable, will be processed within <strong>7 working days</strong>. Please note that the refund amount will be credited after deducting <strong>2.36% payment gateway charges</strong>.</li>
                       </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>No Refund After Shipping:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once your AkshrCard has embarked on its journey to you (a.k.a., shipped), it's yours forever. No refunds. No take-backs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Damaged or Tampered Products:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>We trust our delivery partners, but just in case your package looks like it survived an adventure, <strong>check the seal</strong> before accepting it.</li>
                    <li>If the <strong>seal is broken</strong>, **do not accept** the package! Instead, contact us immediately, and we'll work on a replacement (and maybe give our delivery team a serious talk).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>2. Service Refund Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strict No-Refund Policy on Services:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>When it comes to services like <strong>software development, IT solutions, UI/UX design, and consultation</strong>, once you've paid, there's no going back. No refunds, no exceptions.</li>
                    <li>Whether it's an <strong>advance, partial, or full payment</strong>, once the transaction is done, it's final. (Trust us, we'll do everything to make it worth it!)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>3. Processing Time for Approved Replacements</h2>
        <p>If, by some unfortunate twist of fate, your product arrives damaged and your replacement request is approved, we'll work our magic and send you a fresh one within <strong>7-10 business days</strong> (stock permitting).</p>
